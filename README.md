# Odin Recipes

This project is a collection of recipes that I will be building as part of my journey through The Odin Project. The goal is to practice basic HTML skills and create a simple website that lists different recipes with ingredients and steps.

Once completed, I will have demonstrated skills such as:
- Using basic HTML elements
- Structuring a webpage with proper syntax
- Organizing content in a readable and accessible manner
